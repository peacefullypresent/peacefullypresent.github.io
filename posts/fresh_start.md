Let me paint you a picture. 

Imagine the most normal of days. You've just completed a pretty good day's work, with perhaps one or two things you would've liked to work on but didn't get the chance to do. Nothing crazy. Life goes on. You hang out with some friends, eat dinner and watch some TV before heading over to sleep. You notice your laptop open. Curiously, the earlier stress about the incomplete item starts inflating. This has happened before, sometimes even to the point of panic attacks, in other scenarios. You could step outside and take some deep breaths, or perhaps just go to sleep anyways, but your mind has other ideas. 

Just one search it pleads. Why not? So you go ahead and Google the name of some actress or model that you've stored for easy access in your mind, just to get the mind to calm down a bit. Unfortunately, as you already subconsciously know, things are just getting started. By the time you find that suggestive image, the initial flame roars into an inferno. Every single avenue you've used to find porn in the past becomes fair game, and to the extent possible, you break down every restriction you hoped would stop you in just a moment like this.

No need to pay, the internet is full of free porn! You find that new movie you remember you didn't see from last time and scroll through some new adult subreddits. 1 hour passes as you continue to edge. Ah, now for the usual stop. You head ever to play some porn VNs <footnote> visual novels </footnote> or RPGs <footnote> role-player games </footnote>, sometimes opening 4-5 games all at once, rotating between each game when one game gets too slow. 2 more hours pass. At this time, all the games seem too slow! So instead you open a separate browser with hardcore content to stimulate the mind when all the games get too boring. 1 more hour passes, and by this point it's almost 3 am. You need to finish up soon since you have that meeting the next day in the morning. 

The wise part of your mind, at this point a dull background actor, whimpers in the back with relief. Only 4 hours this time, it cries with joy! Thankfully you had that meeting in the morning, otherwise you might've surpassed your all-time record of 8 hours nonstop from a couple years ago.  You spend the next 30 minutes cycling through content genres that might hit the hardest. By this point, the content has reached depraved levels, but you're in a trance. It doesn't matter as long as it satisfies the itch. Finally, you get to a time that leaves you with enough sleep so that you can not raise suspicion among others and do the minimal amount you have to get done. You decide on a video and it's finally over. 

By this point, you're back to your senses, and you hazily set aside the laptop in disgust. After cleaning up, you go back to bed while flashes of images and videos appear in your mind. "I thought I was done with this". Even though your brain is completely fried by this point, you try to think back to where you went wrong. You remember it really was nothing. A wave of helplessness overcomes you and you think to yourself: "Next time."

You try to be hopeful in the morning and forget about what happened. By this point though, you're just trying to get through the next day. You know your sleep pattern for the next few days is obviously ruined, your mind is still in a haze, and by the time you get through the meeting, you're exhausted. Sometimes, you're able to move on from the experience. Sometimes, you're not even allowed this. Some negative emotions from the experience might lead to another trigger and the cycle starts all over again, sometimes the same week, sometimes the following day, sometimes even the same day. 

You know the drill though. This is something you've gotten used to over the last several years of your life. Your sense of autonomy, self-competency, and self-respect are broken by this point, but the best you can do is trudge along.

Welcome to a day in the life of a porn addict.

## Why now?

I was waiting for the right moment to start this. I'd always imagined it would be when I was a matured, wiser person - someone who could lend advice to others still facing this soul-sucking addiction. As much as I'd like to tell you that I am that man today, the truth is I'm not there yet. I still slip up from time to time, and I'm still recovering. I imagine some of you who might be reading this might be able to relate to this feeling in some way. 

So why write about this now? A few reasons. 

For starters, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that porn addiction thrives in solitude <footnote> big shoutout to Relay for their work here in building a community. I really appreciate you guys. </footnote> When I say solitude, I don't just mean alone time (which is almost always the case anyways). I mean a feeling that the people around you don't *really* understand you. That no matter how social you are, whoever you surround yourself with, you're really living a double life. Something that makes the loneliness even worse, which further fuels the addiction, becoming one absolute hell of a feedback loop. In my small way, I hope sharing my experiences can help others feel less alone in this and come out the other side stronger, including myself.

As for what I hope to achieve through this blog, well, one of the side effects of going through an addiction like this is examining myself and my mind, perhaps a bit more closely than others, if only to understand why I continue to self-sabotage myself like I do. In the process, I've learned some things. I hope to share some tips, both in the form of guides, but equally if not more importantly, how to build a life that doesn't need it anymore. I hope to keep developing this to the point of being able to help provide some hope to someone at their lowest point, back to a version filled with self-confidence and zeal for life. I've certainly felt this version of myself at fleeting moments, and it's the shining light of others that tells me it's worth striving for freedom. 

Lastly, this problem is starting to finally receiving more attention, most recently with HB-1181 (Paxton v. Free Speech Coalition), which passed 6-3 in the Supreme Court to mandate porn websites to use age verification in the state of Texas <footnote> I will share my thoughts on this in a future post </footnote>. I hope to add to this conversation as this topic enters the public sphere. The internet is becoming a hostile place for kids and will continue to impact their health in countless ways.

I hope this can encourage more conversations and allow more people to share their stories.

## Who am I?

Now, who am I? I'm 23 years old, grew up in the Midwest and come from a moderately traditional Indian Hindu family. I've graduated from college and recently graduated with a Master's degree in the field of AI.  <footnote> I've decided to keep the blog anonymous for now, though this may change in the future </footnote>. I've also had a porn addiction for the past 12 years of my life, something I've been seriously trying to quit for many of those years. 

My first exposure to porn was back in fifth grade, when I was ten years old. It really picked up the following year, when our family moved to a new town. Over the course of the next several posts, I'll go through my story, not because I'm special or anything, but because I learned some valuable lessons at different points in my life. Moreover, much of this writing is for myself as much as it might be for you. I still have a long way to go and I hope to keep learning everyday.

I want to clarify that I don't necessarily view porn as an inherent evil from a moralistic stance, mostly from the observation that many people in the world use it without the same negative consequences, which I personally don't think makes those people bad. There is certainly evidence that many adults <footnote> key word here is adults! </footnote> can use porn in a healthy manner in addition to some positive benefits for couples <footnote> Gouvernet, B., Rebelo, T., Sebbe, F.,  Hentati, Y., Yougbaré, S., Combaluzier, S., & Rezrazi, A. (2017). Is pornography pathogen by itself? Study of the role of attachment  profiles on the relationship between pornography and sexual  satisfaction. *Sexologies*, *26*(3), e27-e33. </footnote>, which can't be ignored. That being said, I do think there are some ***seriously*** messed up things going on in that industry. Though masturbation is definitely a component of the problem, I think masturbation on its own is not necessarily harmful, especially when done in moderation, though there are many caveats here I've observed for myself, especially on the recovery journey.

## Before I end

From my experiences, it is my firm belief that many years from now, society will look back aghast and completely horrified with how we have allowed things to have been taken so far, both in the direction of technology and the Internet and in what we did (and most importantly, didn't do) to change it. Primarily the tech industry and the adult industry (though others as well) will have caused a disastrous effect in not only the productivity of the next generation, but also on their life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. I'll share more thoughts on this in the future. 

For now, that's all I have. For anyone familiar with the pain and suffering associated with this addiction, I hope that this blog may have resonated with you. I'd love to hear from you and your thoughts. For anyone else reading this, I hope this can aid your understanding.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I wish all of you peace.
