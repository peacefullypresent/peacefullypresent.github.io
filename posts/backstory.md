EP 4, Sobriety: 1

A couple weeks past when I'd hoped to make this post, but life got in the way. A series of personal trips and other professional events conspired to make this post nice and juicy, with some eventful updates. If I had to summarize the updates in my recovery from the past few weeks in one word, it would be ***honesty***. 

In my last post, I'd mentioned the cross-country road trip that occupied my Thanksgiving break. Alongside that trip was my dad. This setting created the sparks for what I believe to be a major step in my road to recovery. Before I continue, I think a little bit of backstory is due. 



### Backstory

Both my parents both deeply shaped who I've become, and I honor them greatly for providing me with such a comfortable life without having to worry about basically anything financial-related, including college, shelter, food, luxury, travel, and even deep cultural connection, though I can still choose to be honest about how their relationship towards me shaped my porn addiction. 

They're quite intense people and come from relatively traditional families in India, who wanted to maintain that culture after coming to the US. Given those social values, anything sex-related simply was not the most comfortable conversation topic growing up, and it was only discussed if I brought it up first. No "talk" when we entered puberty. Any movie with such scenes was always skipped through. I was never caught <footnote> I did a good job of hiding </footnote> , or even if I was, they never pulled me aside to talk about it <footnote> though I later (i.e., last few weeks) learned how they never really suspected anything was happening </footnote>. When I first shared my experience in tears, I was scared what they'd say given their stance. They showed empathy, but due to lack of understanding of the situation of the Internet and online porn, also very lightly suggested I "should not watch it again" without realizing the full extent of what was happening. 

Of course, I got more curious after this first reprimand. I kept watching without any conversation, despite continuing to use porn as a coping mechanism for anxiety, tiredness, boredom, rejection, or really any kind of negative emotion. Mistakes were made on my side for not opening up due to guilt and the following shame, and perhaps some mistakes were made on their end for not being more proactive when they saw that certain tendencies of underlying problems, like chronic procrastination and lack of meaningful friendships in school (something which became more pronounced when we moved to an area with far fewer Indian families, something I had grown used to). Most of all, as I discussed earlier, is the complete lack of transparency on this topic growing up, while tech companies and the adult industry ran a mass social experiment on the population of kids, unbeknownst to anyone involved. 

For a long time, things remained this way, until my junior year of college, when I could not contain the shame any longer and shared everything with them again in tears, only by this point the habit had unfortunately become deeply entrenched into my life. They listened with empathy again and tried to help by being supportive listeners as I continued to share in the following months, but at some point they stopped asking. I connected this back to them making light of the situation and not wanting to talk about an uncomfortable topic for everyone, so I stopped sharing, yet again.



### Moving Onwards

So far, you might have gotten the idea that sharing is really painful and maybe not the best idea, if all it brings is suffering. The first part - that it is painful - is undoubtedly the case. The second part is the crucial mistake I made in my interpretation, which prolonged my suffering more than necessary. 

It turns out that sitting next to someone without distractions for hours on end (aka a cross-country road trip) can turn out to be a blessing to clear the air on lots of issues <footnote> While we're on this, I'd also recommend sharing while in the passenger seat. It needs a lot of emotional energy, something that might not be so good to do while driving. And it forces the receiver to just listen, since they need to focus on the road after all. There really might be a science to this! </footnote>. This was certainly the case for me at least. And on the third day of the trip, after opening up on other topics that had been causing both of us stress, almost exactly 4 years after I shared everything last time, in the middle of nothing in Oklahoma, the opportunity arose. 

To be continued...
