EP: 5, Sobriety: 0


I'm going to start including my emotional pain and sobriety days for the day I post this. Hopefully provides some context for the journey ahead. I've been on a rough streak this week, but I still hope today's topic helps.

In today's post, I want to discuss the role of blocker software <footnote> there's also accountability software like Covenant Eyes, but I don't have any experience with these, so I won't speak to this </footnote>. My opinion on blockers has varied a lot over the years, and I've been trying to come to healthier ways of using them, from leveraging their utility to not depending on them completely, something I've been working on. My first point is that ultimately, I've found them to **not be the solution**, because ultimately, the *behavior of acting out on the urge* (i.e., relapsing to unwanted sexual behavior such as porn) is not the root problem. I've experienced countless instances where I've felt that everything was blocked, so I'd be completely safe, only to find myself in a new circumstance where I was vulnerable and I gave in, because internally, I was still the same.

This theme of the external vs. the internal will be a recurring topic on this blog, something I'll get to in the future. I've found that both blockers and moderating social media use (last post) come under the **external** side of things (controlling the output). For anyone on this journey still only focusing on stopping the unwanted sexual behavior, *please* don't just focus on that. It might seem like the problem, but really, it's just the surface level way we run away from our pain. I've spent so much time trying to get rid of this in increasingly ridiculous ways, which I'll outline below.

So, what's the point of blockers then? Well, early into developing momentum, I've found them to be useful **guardrails**. Something to add some friction, when we're having a very rough day. Many of the relapses for me have been about the chase, which is when the dopamine is also usually released, so even knowing that I have something in place gives me a level of comfort and allows me to listen to my emotions instead. But I repeat, the blockers are NEVER a substitute for the internal work needed to move forwards. They simply create imaginary control over the behavior. Spoiler alert: it never lasts.

Like I mentioned earlier, if you're not careful (i.e., no self-care or processing emotions), the blockers simply become a challenge for the brain for how to break the barriers. I'm not proud of how I've done this in the past. As someone who is somewhat tech-savvy, this itself has provided quite the thrill at times, finding ways on my laptop to get around the restrictions I myself laid out in anticipation of this. In the extreme case, it's involved using other devices which don't have the same restrictions, even shared TVs at times. A past version of me would say "If only there was the perfect setup, I would be free of porn", but I think that misses the point.

With all those caveats out of the way, let me explain my favorite blockers that I've used, and how I use them:

* Physical lockbox

* Cold Turkey 

* Tech Lockdown (amazing articles too, founded by someone with similar articles), supervised mode

* Admin privilieges & File blocking (modification of obsidian plugins folder/removing surfing dummy file to prevent browser, not admin, protected on both; prevent deletion of plugins folder to just recreate
