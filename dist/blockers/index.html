        <p>EP: 5, Sobriety: 0</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to start including my emotional pain and sobriety days for the day I post this. Hopefully provides some context for the journey ahead. I&#39;ve been on a rough streak this week, but I still hope today&#39;s topic helps.</p>
<p>In today&#39;s post, I want to discuss the role of blocker software <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup>. My opinion on blockers has varied a lot over the years, and I&#39;ve been trying to come to healthier ways of using them, from leveraging their utility to not depending on them completely, something I&#39;ve been working on. My first point is that ultimately, I&#39;ve found them to <strong>not be the solution</strong>, because ultimately, the <em>behavior of acting out on the urge</em> (i.e., relapsing to unwanted sexual behavior such as porn) is not the root problem. I&#39;ve experienced countless instances where I&#39;ve felt that everything was blocked, so I&#39;d be completely safe, only to find myself in a new circumstance where I was vulnerable and I gave in, because internally, I was still the same.</p>
<p>This theme of the external vs. the internal will be a recurring topic on this blog, something I&#39;ll get to in the future. I&#39;ve found that both blockers and moderating social media use (last post) come under the <strong>external</strong> side of things (controlling the output). For anyone on this journey still only focusing on stopping the unwanted sexual behavior, <em>please</em> don&#39;t just focus on that. It might seem like the problem, but really, it&#39;s just the surface level way we run away from our pain. I&#39;ve spent so much time trying to get rid of this in increasingly ridiculous ways, which I&#39;ll outline below.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s the point of blockers then? Well, early into developing momentum, I&#39;ve found them to be useful <strong>guardrails</strong>. Something to add some friction, when we&#39;re having a very rough day. Many of the relapses for me have been about the chase, which is when the dopamine is also usually released, so even knowing that I have something in place gives me a level of comfort and allows me to listen to my emotions instead. But I repeat, the blockers are NEVER a substitute for the internal work needed to move forwards. They simply create imaginary control over the behavior. Spoiler alert: it never lasts.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, if you&#39;re not careful (i.e., no self-care or processing emotions), the blockers simply become a challenge for the brain for how to break the barriers. I&#39;m not proud of how I&#39;ve done this in the past. As someone who is somewhat tech-savvy, this itself has provided quite the thrill at times, finding ways on my laptop to get around the restrictions I myself laid out in anticipation of this. In the extreme case, it&#39;s involved using other devices which don&#39;t have the same restrictions, even shared TVs at times. A past version of me would say &quot;If only there was the perfect setup, I would be free of porn&quot;, but I think that misses the point.</p>
<p>With all those caveats out of the way, let me explain my favorite blockers that I&#39;ve used, and how I use them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Physical lockbox</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cold Turkey </p>
</li>
<li><p>Tech Lockdown (amazing articles too, founded by someone with similar articles), supervised mode</p>
</li>
<li><p>Admin privilieges &amp; File blocking (modification of obsidian plugins folder/removing surfing dummy file to prevent browser, not admin, protected on both; prevent deletion of plugins folder to just recreate</p>
</li>
</ul>
