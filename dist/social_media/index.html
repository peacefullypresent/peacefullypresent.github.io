      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Due to lack of time, but in the hopes of making consistent posts, I&#39;m sharing a bit of a shorter post today. In particular, today I want to share some thoughts on triggers and urges in general.</p>
<p>I&#39;d define <strong>triggers</strong> as sites or stimuli that have the effect of generating urges. These usually contain some level of adult content or sensitive material. <strong>Urges</strong>, or <strong>cravings</strong>, manifest from the dopamine-seeking part of our brain to find material that will satisfy the itch until completion, at which point they fade away. An important point here that I&#39;ve understood over the years is that urges are totally natural, even though I used to demonize these. To put it simply, <strong>triggers lead to urges</strong> but urges don&#39;t always come from triggers. </p>
<p>This is where a key point comes into the picture: social media. By far the most common triggers for me in the past have been through social media. This is also why I separate porn use from watching YouTube or social media in general (at least for myself), because the former is far, <em>far</em>, more potent than the latter. The latter usually is usually the starting point for the former, when my mind is searching for the trigger but there is some initial resistance to go off the deep end. Usually, it involves some quick mental gymnastics, effectively aided by the insidious engagement-based design of social media platforms, where my mind says, &quot;Oh. You know it&#39;s just this one video, you&#39;re not going to go down that path again,&quot; all while I know full well what I&#39;m doing. The flow of increasing urges during a session always points one direction: social media to porn (though after PMO then social media watching lethargically is standard).</p>
<p>Living like this throughout high school and college has been <em>extremely</em> difficult, to say the least. Not only does it involve constantly readjusting my time to manage my actual responsibilities, but it also means lots of lying. What starts out as perhaps innocent sessions of taking a break turn into depraved binge sessions, seamlessly guided by the slippery slide of modern technology. </p>
<p>This brings me to my final point of this post. Where the urges lead to is almost always the porn sites, but where they start is usually not there, especially once a basic level of adult filters are implemented. So we need to ask ourselves a crucial question: when did porn addiction actually become a widespread problem? If we&#39;re arguing it&#39;s always been there since the days of magazines, fine. But if it&#39;s a recent phenomenon, and I think it clearly is, then we&#39;re misplacing the blame. The real culprit isn&#39;t really the porn industry itself; it&#39;s <em>Big Tech and the internet&#39;s engagement-centric design</em> (driven by ad-based revenue, which is what also what incentivizes more porn sites to pop online if you notice all those pesky ads). It&#39;s like blaming delivery companies for car failures when the real issue is the car itself. Platforms like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube are equally complicit here. I&#39;ve had to block Reddit for stretches at a time because getting past the adult content barriers (i.e., clicking, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m Over 18&quot; is ridiculously easy. If we&#39;re serious about creating change, we need to target tech companies that have weaponized human&#39;s impulsive nature for profit. They&#39;ve built systems designed to exploit our vulnerabilities, and that&#39;s where our focus should be. Shame on them.</p>
