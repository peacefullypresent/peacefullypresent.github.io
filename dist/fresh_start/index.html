        <h1>Storytime</h1>
<p>Let me paint you a picture. </p>
<p>Imagine the most normal of days. You&#39;ve just completed a pretty good day&#39;s work, with perhaps one or two things you would&#39;ve liked to work on but didn&#39;t get the chance to do. Nothing crazy. Life goes on. You hang out with some friends, eat dinner and watch some TV before heading over to sleep. You notice your laptop open. Curiously, the earlier stress about the incomplete item starts inflating. This has happened before, sometimes even to the point of panic attacks, in other scenarios. You could step outside and take some deep breaths, or perhaps just go to sleep anyways, but your mind has other ideas. </p>
<p>Just one search it pleads. Why not? So you go ahead and Google the name of some actress or model, just to get the mind to calm down a bit. Unfortunately, things are just getting started. By the time you find that suggestive image, the initial flame roars into an inferno. Every single avenue you&#39;ve used to find porn in the past becomes fair game, and to the extent possible, you break down every restriction you hoped would stop you in just a moment like this.</p>
<p>No need to pay, the internet is full of free porn! You find that new movie you remember you didn&#39;t see from last time and scroll through some new adult subreddits. 1 hour passes as you continue to edge. Ah, now for the usual stop. You head ever to play some porn VNs <sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> or RPGs <sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup>, sometimes opening 4-5 games all at once, rotating between each game until the next scene when one game gets too slow. 2 more hours pass. This time, all the games seem too slow! So instead you open a separate browser with hardcore content to stimulate the mind when the games get too boring. 1 more hour passes, and by this point it&#39;s almost 3 am. You need to finish up soon since you have that meeting the next day. </p>
<p>The rational part of your mind whimpers in the back with relief. Only 4 hours this time, it cries with joy! Thankfully you had that meeting in the morning, otherwise you might&#39;ve surpassed your all-time record of 8 hours nonstop from a couple years ago.  You spend the next 30 minutes cycling through content genres that might hit the hardest. By this point, the content has reached depraved levels, but you&#39;re in a trance. It doesn&#39;t matter as long as it satisfies the itch. Thirty minutes later, you find that video and it&#39;s finally over. </p>
<p>By this point, you&#39;re back to your senses, and you hazily set aside the laptop in disgust. After cleaning up, you go back to bed while flashes of images and videos appear in your mind. &quot;I thought I was done with this&quot;. Even though your brain is completely fried by this point, you try to think back to where you went wrong. You remember it really was nothing. A wave of helplessness overcomes you and you think to yourself: &quot;Next time.&quot;</p>
<p>You try to be hopeful in the morning and forget about what happened. By this point though, you&#39;re just trying to get through the next day. Your sleep is obviously ruined, your mind is still in a haze, and by the time you get through the meeting, you&#39;re exhausted. Sometimes, you&#39;re able to move on from the experience. Sometimes, you&#39;re not even allowed this. Some negative emotions from the experience might lead to another trigger and the cycle starts all over again, sometimes the same week, sometimes the following day, sometimes even the same day. </p>
<p>You know the drill though. This is something you&#39;ve gotten used to over the last several years of your life. Your sense of autonomy, self-competency, and self-respect are broken by this point, but the best you can do is trudge along.</p>
<p>This is my experience with porn addiction.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>I was waiting for the right moment to start this. I&#39;d always imagined it would be when I was a matured, wiser person - someone who could lend advice to others still facing this soul-sucking addiction. As much as I&#39;d like to tell you that I am that man today, the truth is I&#39;m not there yet. I still slip up from time to time, and I&#39;m still recovering. I imagine some of you who might be reading this might be able to relate to this feeling in some way. </p>
<p>So why write about this now? A few reasons. </p>
<p>For starters, if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that porn addiction thrives in solitude. When I say solitude, I don&#39;t just mean alone time (which is almost always the case anyways). I mean a feeling that the people around you don&#39;t <em>really</em> understand you. That no matter how social you are, whoever you surround yourself with, you&#39;re really living a double life. Something that makes the loneliness even worse, which further fuels the addiction, becoming one absolute hell of a feedback loop. In my small way, I hope sharing my experiences can help others feel less alone in this and come out the other side stronger, including myself.</p>
<p>As for what I hope to achieve through this blog, well, one of the side effects of going through an addiction like this is examining myself and my mind, perhaps a bit more closely than others, if only to understand why I continue to self-sabotage myself like I do. In the process, I&#39;ve learned some things. I&#39;ll share some tips, both in the form of guides, but equally if not more importantly, how to build a life that doesn&#39;t need it anymore. I hope to keep developing this to the point of being able to guide someone at their lowest point, back to a version filled with self-confidence and zeal for life. I&#39;ve certainly felt this version of myself at fleeting moments, and it&#39;s the shining light that tells me it&#39;s worth striving for freedom. </p>
<p>Lastly, this problem is starting to finally receiving more attention, most recently with HB-1181 (Paxton v. Free Speech Coalition), which passed 6-3 in the Supreme Court to mandate porn websites to use age verification in the state of Texas <sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>. I hope to add to this conversation as this topic enters the public sphere. The internet is becoming a hostile place for kids and will continue to impact their health in countless ways. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Now, who am I? I&#39;m 23 years old, grew up in the Midwest and come from a moderately traditional Indian Hindu family. I&#39;ve graduated from college and recently graduated with a Master&#39;s degree, and I currently work in the field of AI.  <sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>. I&#39;ve also had a porn addiction for the past 12 years of my life, something I&#39;ve been seriously trying to quit for many of those years. </p>
<p>My first exposure to porn was back in fifth grade, when I was ten years old. It really picked up the following year, when our family moved to a new town. But I&#39;ll reveal everything in due time. Over the course of the next several posts, I&#39;ll go through my story, not because I&#39;m special or anything, but because I learned some valuable lessons at different points in my life. It took me a long time to get where I am, and I still have a long way to go. In each post, I&#39;ll share part of my journey and pick  a lesson or two I&#39;ve learned since then. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Before I end</h2>
<p>Before I end, I want to clarify that I don&#39;t view porn as an evil from a moralistic stance (I&#39;m a weak agnostic - ==link==), though I do think there are some seriously messed up things going on in that industry. I understand many adults <sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> can use porn in a healthy manner (==cite==) in addition to some positive benefits for couples ( ==again cite==). Though masturbation is definitely a component of the problem, I think masturbation on its own is not necessarily harmful, especially when done in moderation and healthily <sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many years from now, society will look back aghast and completely horrified with what content and when they allowed kids to begin viewing the Internet. Primarily the tech industry and the adult industry (though others as well) will have caused a disastrous effect in not only the productivity of the next generation, but also on their life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>I hope that if you resonated with this in any way at all or are interested to hear more, this blog can be of some use to you. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I wish all of you peace.</p>
<p>==one more final point==</p>
<p>I separate porn use from watching YouTube or social media in general (at least for myself), because the former is far, <em>far</em>, more potent than the latter. The latter usually is usually the starting point for the former, when my mind is searching for the trigger but there is some resistance to go off the deep end. Living like this throughout high school, undergrad, and grad school has been <em>extremely</em> difficult, to say the least. Not only does it involve constantly readjusting my time to manage my actual responsibilities, but it also means lots of lying. To put it another way, the flow of increasing urges during a session always points one direction: social media to porn (though after PMO then social media watching lethargically is standard)</p>
<p>==add in appropriate other post or as motivation==</p>
<p>Argument for allopathic. High friction (literally impossible to watch) allowed me to ride the wave of the urge without reacting!</p>
<p>Argument for preventative. It’s the environment and psychological factors that cause addiction, not the actual behavior itself</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 7% of heavy drinkers ever become addicted to alcohol</li>
<li>Connection with like-minded people, happy relationships, work that is challenging/stimulating/purposeful and a peaceful lifestyle otherwise are the key<ul>
<li>Moving in this direction is what listening to myself looks like</li>
<li>Everything else are just temporary training wheels AND WILL NOT solve the problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>==example note to journal after an incident (add to a post)==</p>
<ul>
<li>Slipped twice<ul>
<li>TV yesterday (YT)<ul>
<li>For TV, being with a friend helps, otherwise hiding the remote with &lt;relative/friend&gt; might help</li>
<li>Again, before I search, there is a window of opportunity where I can choose to browser or not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Laptop today (found another browser that wasn’t covered)<ul>
<li>Insanely hard to find alternatives → if I can get up and urge surf at the start, I can let it go</li>
<li>Friction is really high, it only becomes possible to find stuff once I’m already set on the path<ul>
<li>Already covered bases with other sites/browsers here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before that is a window where I can choose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue is the following: once my mind is set on this → I have literally zero willpower to stop it, <strong>it uses every critical thinking faculty at its disposal to find the right links</strong> ==add to story at top==<ul>
<li>Rough, rough man</li>
<li>I might go down the impulsive path of searching in both cases, but if I add in friction (ColdTurkey/remote hiding/etc.) → I increase the window of opportunity where I can let go of the urge and come back to sanity<ul>
<li>It becomes really, really hard to find the things I’m looking for (yesterday I couldn’t for 45 min)</li>
<li>This morning it also took 30 min</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I can pause the urge before it gets away from me (some drastic action), I can do this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is the strategy → add as much friction as possible, and then when the impulse does come (which is super, super strong), I might cave at the start, but my system will protect me<ul>
<li>During this time I need to count on myself to make the right choice<ul>
<li>I can’t control now how future me will react in those moments of opportunity</li>
<li>But I have to realize I have something worth fighting for</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, systems in place to ensure I know exactly what I’m doing at any given time and I’m not idly sitting around (like last night)<ul>
<li>That way, my actions just flow!</li>
<li>This is already DONE (needs minor fixes)!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there will be moments of weakness inevitably, and in those moments my system will protect me, but not forever<ul>
<li>System is very solid</li>
<li>I have to create a SIMPLE intention (which again I can plan in advance), and simply execute<ul>
<li>Need to do</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, it happened, I’ve identified the principles at play</li>
<li>Detach, and forgive myself!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
